    <h2>History of Google</h2>
    <p>Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in Stanford, California. The project initially involved an unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company.</p>

    <h2>Growth</h2>
    <p>In March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California,which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.</p>
